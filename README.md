# Lab 1 ECE356 UTK 2024

This lab generates the fibonacci seqeunce of numbers using the Visual assembly language. 

Part 1 only generates the fibonacci number, at the index of the input. E.G. 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 1, 3 = 2, and so on. 
Part 2 limits these to even/odd numbers. 
Part 3 limits these to prime numbers. Note that this language does not have division, so it is computationally intensive to find a prime. Typically the software will warn about an "infinite" loop when running with larger inputs. This can be ignored, its just the repeated subtraction that can cause these warnings.
